- Difference between a `library` and `framework`?
Ans: `Library` and `framework` are both the code written by someone else. And we use these libraries and framework to help in our project or the application we are building.
Think of Library as going to ikea for buying the furniture for our home wheers as the framework is like building a home .You have a set of blue print and the contractor is in the control for building the house.

`Technically speaking` the difference lies in the `inversion of control` while using library we have the control when we want to use that library Whereas when you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
